# K-means Clustering for Image Compression

This project implements the K-means algorithm and applies it to compress images by reducing the number of colors while preserving image quality. It includes Python code for finding closest centroids, computing centroid means, and compressing images using K-means clustering.

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Week8_KMeans_Assignment.ipynb`) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.
3. The notebook includes sections for loading the image, preprocessing the data, running K-means clustering, and compressing the image.

## Dataset

The dataset used is an image file containing thousands of colors represented in RGB format.

## How to Run

Ensure that you have Python installed along with the required libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. Open the `Week8_KMeans_Assignment.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially. Experiment with different values of K and observe the effects on image compression.
